# api-token-java-example
This repository is a collection of examples in Java to create and verify api tokens.

## Why this repository?

Inspired by a post titled `API Tokens: A Tedious Survey` - https://fly.io/blog/api-tokens-a-tedious-survey/, I wanted to understand various tokens, how to create and verify them. This repository is intended for a quick reference to learn about various api tokens in Java.
